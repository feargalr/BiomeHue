Description: Generates systematic, phylogenetically-informed colours for
    microbiome barplots using the HCL colour space. Colours are automatically
    assigned based on taxonomic lineage, with variation to distinguish related
    taxa. Includes an internal NCBI-derived lineage database and optional NCBI
    API fallback for unknown taxa. Supports bacteria, archaea, and fungi.
